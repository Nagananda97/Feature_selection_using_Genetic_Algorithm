# Feature_selection_using_Genetic_Algorithm
Steps to execute<br>
1. Download the data.csv and jupyter ntoebook file<br>
2. Change the location path.
3. Change the probability of crossing over mutation and the variance in to get better results.
# Overview of the Genetic Algorithm properties 
| Representation of Population | Binary String                        |
|:---:|:---:|
| Fitness function             | F1 score of KNN classifier           |
| Parent Selection             | Roulette wheel                       |
| Crossover                    | One point                            |
| Mutation                     | Random with fixed probability        |
| Stopping Criteria            | Based on the variance of the fitness |
| Input Dataset                | Brest Cancer dataset                 |
